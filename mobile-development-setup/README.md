## Expo Go Setup

Expo Go allows you to instantly preview your React Native app on a physical device.

### Installation Steps (January 2026)

1. Visit https://expo.dev/go
2. Install Expo Go from your device's app store:
   - **Android**: Google Play Store → Search "Expo Go" (by Expo Project)
   - **iOS**: Apple App Store → Search "Expo Go" (by Nametag/Expo)
3. Open the Expo Go app.
4. (Recommended) Sign in with a free Expo account or create one.
5. Run your project with `npx expo start` and scan the QR code with Expo Go.

**Challenges faced**: None during initial setup — installation was smooth via app stores.  
**Notes**: Expo Go always uses the latest SDK version. For older SDKs or custom needs, consider development builds.
